# World Whisperer

Welcome to World Whisperer! This program helps you manage your notes on a fantasy world, vectorizes them, stores them
in a  database, and allows you to interact with the content using ChatGPT.
## Setup

1. Rename SampleNotes to Notes
2. Uncomment the PRIVATE variables in the .env file and add your API keys
3. Inside each subfolder, create files named after the respective items, with the file extension `.md`.
Note that only plain text is supported at this time, and markdown formatting is not stripped. It will function, but
may result in artifacts.
4. Run the program. It will automatically create a `tags.csv` file, asking ChatGPT to generate a series of tags
for each item.
5. Confirm vectorizing the data and storing it in Pinecone when prompted.

## Main Menu

The main menu provides you with three modes of operation:

1. **Interactive Mode**
2. **Questions Mode**
3. **Generator Mode**

### 1. Interactive Mode

In this mode, you can interact with the model by providing the following information:

a. **Admin Command**: This is a short description to guide the response.
        Example: "You are Joe's grandfather telling stories."

b. **Context**: Provide any additional context about the prompt that isn't found in your world notes.
        Example: "Joe is a huge fan of cheese."

c. **Prompt**: Write the actual question or scenario you want ChatGPT to address.
        Example: "Tell me about the time Joe went to Italy and got a pizza."

### 2. Questions Mode

This mode allows you to ask questions about the world directly. Just type your question, and it will provide you
with an answer based on the information stored in the Pinecone database.

### 3. Generator Mode

Generator Mode enables you to create new content for your world, integrating it with existing information.
This can be used to expand your world's lore, create new characters, or develop new locations and artifacts.
In progress is the ability to generate entire worlds of interconnected things from a basic prompt.
